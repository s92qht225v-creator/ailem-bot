# Changelog

All notable changes to the Ailem Bot project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-11-01

### Added
- **Configurable Bonus System**: Added ability to configure bonus percentages from admin panel
  - `purchaseBonus`: Percentage of order total awarded to customer as bonus points
  - `referralCommission`: Percentage of referred user's order awarded to referrer
  - Configuration stored in database `app_settings.bonus_config` column
  - SQL migration file: `add-bonus-config-column.sql`

### Changed

#### Bonus Points System
- **Point Value**: Changed from 1000 UZS per point to 1 UZS per point
  - Files: `src/utils/helpers.js` (lines 99-117)
  - Impact: 1 bonus point = 1 UZS discount (more intuitive for users)

- **Bonus Percentage**: Made configurable via admin panel
  - Default: 10% purchase bonus, 10% referral commission
  - Can be changed to any percentage (e.g., 3%)
  - Webhooks now read from database instead of hardcoded values
  - Files:
    - `api/click-webhook.js` (lines 26-39)
    - `api/payme-webhook.js`
    - `src/components/pages/AdminPanel.jsx` (lines 1877-1996)

#### Payment Webhooks Performance
- **Click Webhook**: Fixed timeout issue by responding immediately before processing bonus points
  - File: `api/click-webhook.js` (lines 182-206)
  - Change: Moved `awardBonusPoints()` to AFTER sending response to Click
  - Impact: Payments no longer stuck in "processing" status

- **Payme Webhook**: Applied same optimization
  - File: `api/payme-webhook.js` (lines 423-442)
  - Change: Moved `awardBonusPoints()` and notifications to AFTER sending response

#### Bonus Points Deduction
- **Fixed Bonus Deduction Bug**: Corrected implementation of bonus points usage during checkout
  - File: `src/components/pages/PaymentPage.jsx` (lines 106-116, 237-247)
  - Before: Called non-existent `updateUser()` function (silently failed)
  - After: Uses correct `updateBonusPoints(-amount)` with negative delta
  - Impact: Bonus points are now properly deducted when used for discounts

#### Referral System Marketing
- **Removed 10% First-Order Discount Claims**: Updated all UI text to reflect actual bonus system
  - Files:
    - `src/components/pages/ReferralsPage.jsx` (lines 102-108, 132-135)
    - `src/utils/telegram.js` (line 268)
  - Before: Claimed "10% off first order" (not actually implemented)
  - After: "Earn bonus points on purchases" (accurate)
  - Impact: Marketing messages now match actual functionality

### Fixed
- **Click Payment Timeout**: Payments were getting stuck in "processing" status
  - Root Cause: Server took >3 seconds to respond to COMPLETE webhook
  - Solution: Respond immediately, then process bonus points asynchronously
  - Status: ✅ Resolved

- **Bonus Points Not Deducted**: Users not losing points when using them for discounts
  - Root Cause: Wrong function call (`updateUser` instead of `updateBonusPoints`)
  - Solution: Use `updateBonusPoints(-amount)` with negative value
  - Status: ✅ Resolved

- **Bonus Settings Not Persisting**: Admin panel changes reset to 10% on page reload
  - Root Cause: Database column `bonus_config` doesn't exist yet
  - Solution: Run SQL migration `add-bonus-config-column.sql`
  - Status: ⚠️ Requires SQL migration to be run

### Database Migrations Required

#### 1. Add Bonus Configuration Column
**File**: `add-bonus-config-column.sql`
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT YET RUN
**Purpose**: Enable configurable bonus percentages via admin panel

```sql
ALTER TABLE app_settings
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bonus_config JSONB DEFAULT '{"purchaseBonus": 10, "referralCommission": 10}'::jsonb;

COMMENT ON COLUMN app_settings.bonus_config IS 'Bonus points configuration: purchaseBonus (% of order total awarded to customer), referralCommission (% of referred user first order awarded to referrer)';

UPDATE app_settings
SET bonus_config = '{"purchaseBonus": 10, "referralCommission": 10}'::jsonb
WHERE id = 1 AND bonus_config IS NULL;
```

**How to Run**:
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Paste the SQL above
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify column exists: `SELECT bonus_config FROM app_settings WHERE id = 1;`

**Impact After Running**:
- Admin panel bonus settings will persist across page reloads
- Webhooks will use configured percentages instead of hardcoded 10%
- Changes in admin panel will immediately affect bonus awarding

#### 2. Pickup Points Enhancements (Optional)
**File**: `add-pickup-points-columns.sql`
**Status**: Unknown
**Purpose**: Add state, city, and active columns to pickup_points table

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Run `add-bonus-config-column.sql` migration in production
- [ ] Test bonus system end-to-end after migration
- [ ] Update documentation files (LOCAL_TESTING.md, TELEGRAM_SETUP.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md) to remove 10% discount mentions

### Known Issues
- **Admin Panel Bonus Config**: Currently only saves to localStorage until SQL migration is run
  - Webhooks use hardcoded 10% default
  - Admin panel shows correct values but doesn't affect actual bonus awarding
  - **Fix**: Run SQL migration

### Breaking Changes
- **Point Value Change**: If you had existing bonus points calculations expecting 1000 UZS per point, they now use 1 UZS per point
  - Impact: Users effectively have 1000x more purchasing power with same point balance
  - Migration: No data migration needed, just behavioral change

### Security
- No security changes in this release

### Performance
- **Webhook Response Time**: Reduced from >3s to <500ms
  - Click/Payme webhooks now respond immediately
  - Bonus processing happens asynchronously after response
  - Impact: No more payment timeouts
