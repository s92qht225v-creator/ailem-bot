## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Telegram Chat ID

You need your Telegram Chat ID to receive admin notifications.

**Option A: Using @userinfobot (Recommended)**
1. Open Telegram
2. Search for `@userinfobot`
3. Start a conversation with the bot
4. It will instantly show your Chat ID
5. Copy the numeric ID (e.g., `123456789`)

**Option B: Using @get_id_bot**
1. Open Telegram
2. Search for `@get_id_bot`
3. Send `/start`
4. Copy your ID

### Step 2: Add Chat ID to Environment Variables

**For Local Development:**

1. Open `.env` file
2. Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_HERE` with your actual Chat ID:
   ```
   VITE_ADMIN_CHAT_ID=123456789
   ```
3. Save the file
4. Restart your dev server (`npm run dev`)

**For Production (Vercel):**

Run these commands:

```bash
# Add admin chat ID
vercel env add VITE_ADMIN_CHAT_ID production
# When prompted, enter your Telegram Chat ID
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test Notifications

1. Place a test order in your app
2. You should receive a Telegram message from your bot with order details
3. The customer should also receive a confirmation message

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Notifications?

1. **Check Bot Token**
   - Make sure `VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly in `.env`
   - The bot token is already configured: `7721843664:AAEDBUydg2j3sxCRTBApCOkMYIg8ZT_eMyw`

2. **Check Admin Chat ID**
   - Make sure you've set `VITE_ADMIN_CHAT_ID` in `.env`
   - Chat ID should be a number (e.g., `123456789`), not text

3. **Verify Bot is Active**
   - Open your bot in Telegram (search for your bot username)
   - Send `/start` to activate the bot
   - The bot must be active to send messages

4. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for notification logs:
     - `üì§ Sending Telegram notification to: [your-chat-id]`
     - `‚úÖ Telegram notification sent successfully`
   - If you see errors, check the error messages

5. **Environment Variables Not Loading?**
   - Restart your dev server after changing `.env`
   - For production, make sure you added the env vars to Vercel and redeployed

### Customer Not Receiving Notifications?

Customers will only receive notifications if:
1. They opened the app through Telegram (not a web browser)
2. Their Telegram ID was captured when they placed the order
3. The bot is active and has permission to send messages

**Note:** Guest users and browser users won't receive notifications since they don't have a Telegram ID.

## Testing Tips

1. **Test with yourself first**
   - Place an order through your Telegram bot
   - You should receive two notifications (one as customer, one as admin)

2. **Test order status changes**
   - Go to Admin Panel
   - Approve or reject a test order
   - Check if you receive status update notifications

3. **Check notification logs**
   - All notification attempts are logged in the browser console
   - Look for success/error messages

## Advanced Configuration

### Customize Notification Messages

Edit `/src/services/telegram.js` to customize notification messages:

- `notifyAdminNewOrder` - Admin notification for new orders
- `notifyUserOrderStatus` - Customer notifications for status changes
- `notifyUserNewOrder` - Customer order confirmation

### Add More Notification Types

The service already includes these ready-to-use functions:

- `notifyReferrerReward` - Notify when someone earns referral points
